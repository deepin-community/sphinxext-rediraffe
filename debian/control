Description: Sphinx Extension to redirect files
 This sphinx extension redirects non-existent pages to working pages.
 Rediraffe can also check that deleted/renamed files in your git repo
 are redirected.
 .
 Rediraffe creates a graph of all specified redirects and traverses it
 to point all internal urls to leaf urls.
 This means that chained redirects will be resolved.
 For example, if a config has 6 chained redirects,
 all 6 links will redirect directly to the final link.
 The end user will never experience more than 1 redirection.
 .
 Note: Rediraffe supports the html and dirhtml builders.
